	00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.810
<Turn 1>	<v Sophie>: So AI in schools? It's really interesting. I mean I think it helps me a lot with everything that I need to do, makes me work a lot less hard </v>
	
	00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.190
<Turn 2>	<v Sophie>:  which is a good thing and a bad thing. What do you think?</v>
	
	00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.530
<Turn 3>	<v Peter>: I think schools are about preparing children for </v>
	
	00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.950
<Turn 4>	<v Peter>:  the adulthood.</v>
	
	00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.980
<Turn 5>	<v Peter>:  and I actually think schools need to up their game a bit, because it's like </v>
	
	00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.190
<Turn 6>	<v Peter>:  the real world or the world after school is advancing with AI and technology extensively </v>
	
	00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.330
<Turn 7>	<v Peter>: But schools are still kind of in their traditional way, figuring out, there have been some changes </v>
	
	00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.880
<Turn 8>	<v Peter>: But bottom line I think schools need to actually speed up a bit and make more changes than they've made.</v>
	
	00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.190
<Turn 9>	<v Olivia>: Oh I absolutely agree with all of you. These are such great points.</v>
	
	00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.730
<Turn 10>	<v Olivia>: For example, like what you were saying about  how the real world is definitely not waiting for </v>
	
	00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.890
<Turn 11>	<v Olivia>:  the schools to catch up to what AI is doing </v>
	
	00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.020
<Turn 12>	<v Olivia>:  and with </v>
	
	00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.070
<Turn 13>	<v Olivia>:  honestly </v>
	
	00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.220
<Turn 14>	<v Olivia>:  the weekly developments in what's going on with AI, schools are staying so far behind, and there's always a cat and mouse game.</v>
	
	00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.430
<Turn 15>	<v Olivia>:  and uh I'm thinking  </v>
	
	00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.910
<Turn 16>	<v Olivia>:  it would be very beneficial for the schools to utilize the summer break to try to </v>
	
	00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.690
<Turn 17>	<v Olivia>:  rethink their curriculum and what they would do with, especially </v>
	
	00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.950
<Turn 18>	<v Olivia>:  elementary school </v>
	
	00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.650
<Turn 19>	<v Olivia>:  uh to  this is the time to </v>
	
	00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
<Turn 20>	<v Olivia>:  let them have critical thinking and if they don't have that </v>
	
	00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.440
<Turn 21>	<v Olivia>:  in that early age with AI </v>
	
	00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.120
<Turn 22>	<v Olivia>:  they would be  so far behind by the time they get to high school.</v>
	
	00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.470
<Turn 23>	<v Sophie>: Right.</v>
	
	00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.480
<Turn 24>	<v Jim>: Yeah what I mean I agree with all of you, but </v>
	
	00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.730
<Turn 25>	<v Jim>:  there's a problem of cheating.</v>
	
	00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.430
<Turn 26>	<v Jim>: I mean how do we deal with that? It's  students are just gonna ask hey ChatGPT, just write whatever you want </v>
	
	00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520
<Turn 27>	<v Jim>:  right? Just write my homework for me, I'm never going to study, I'm just gonna </v>
	
	00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.000
<Turn 28>	<v Sophie>: I feel  yeah I feel </v>
	
	00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.010
<Turn 29>	<v Jim>:  copy paste the questions into AI. And Hey, I have all the answers, I'm getting one hundred and everything </v>
	
	00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.610
<Turn 30>	<v Sophie>:  it just teaches people to work a lot less hard I feel like.</v>
	
	00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.300
<Turn 31>	<v Jim>:  like why work?</v>
	
	00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.260
<Turn 32>	<v Jim>: Yeah.</v>
	
	00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.020
<Turn 33>	<v Peter>:  But I think the reason that has  is because the schools are still in this traditional system.</v>
	
	00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.000
<Turn 34>	<v Sophie>: Sometimes.</v>
	
	00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.720
<Turn 35>	<v Peter>: The schools need to change their system, so that the concept of cheating </v>
	
	00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.870
<Turn 36>	<v Peter>:  can't be a concern because </v>
	
	00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.690
<Turn 37>	<v Peter>:  they almost more aligned. I think the biggest opportunity is </v>
	
	00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.380
<Turn 38>	<v Peter>:  if someone wants to establish a private school and do things completely differently, and parents will take a step back and think </v>
	
	00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.530
<Turn 39>	<v Peter>:  OK this actually make sense based on where the world is going </v>
	
	00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.620
<Turn 40>	<v Peter>:  and based on the other schools on offer </v>
	
	00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.490
<Turn 41>	<v Peter>:  and then maybe this trend will become more and more popular and </v>
	
	00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.030
<Turn 42>	<v Peter>:  whoever establishes this private school system will become a multimillionaire um </v>
	
	00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.150
<Turn 43>	<v Peter>:  but I think the bottom line is the system needs to change </v>
	
	00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.530
<Turn 44>	<v Peter>:  in the schools </v>
	
	00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.320
<Turn 45>	<v Jim>: Uh so </v>
	
	00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.310
<Turn 46>	<v Peter>:  because externally, it won't.</v>
	
	00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.270
<Turn 47>	<v Jim>: But how do we make sure that students actually study something and don't just like </v>
	
	00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.160
<Turn 48>	<v Jim>:  cheat </v>
	
	00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.300
<Turn 49>	<v Jim>:  and then </v>
	
	00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.380
<Turn 50>	<v Jim>:  they go home and well I didn't learn something aside from I don't know writing the right prompt to get my homework better  done better, or even not. Some students are so lazy, they'll just </v>
	
	00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.070
<Turn 51>	<v Jim>:  like </v>
	
	00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.050
<Turn 52>	<v Jim>:  type something whatever in the chat </v>
	
	00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.480
<Turn 53>	<v Jim>:  do you know like an AI and   Let's just </v>
	
	00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.730
<Turn 54>	<v Jim>:  hand it  in, doesn't matter.</v>
	
	00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.820
<Turn 55>	<v Olivia>: I agree, and I think this is what the old system is making </v>
	
	00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.540
<Turn 56>	<v Olivia>:  it very easy for the students to do now, however if you create a </v>
	
	00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.500
<Turn 57>	<v Olivia>:  project or you create something that they would have to present, they would have to critically think over a topic, and they would have to actually do it as a whole </v>
	
	00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.420
<Turn 58>	<v Olivia>:  um </v>
	
	00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.630
<Turn 59>	<v Olivia>:  holistic view, not just  oh here's a  a summary of this book and just  and read this and then do a </v>
	
	00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.650
<Turn 60>	<v Olivia>:  test on it if you actually have to explore what the times was like and try to do a reenactment or try to do something that would be </v>
	
	00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.150
<Turn 61>	<v Olivia>:  uh live and in the classroom and that would make you think about how would  I would want to present it and how I would want to do it.</v>
	
	00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.210
<Turn 62>	<v Olivia>: You can use the tools because it's an advantage it's almost I look at it like </v>
	
	00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.200
<Turn 63>	<v Olivia>:  we have maps and we would use a map application versus using paper. Nobody uses paper maps anymore.</v>
	
	00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.250
<Turn 64>	<v Olivia>: You would use the maps on your phone.</v>
	
	00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.630
<Turn 65>	<v Olivia>: So I think that's </v>
	
	00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:59.770
<Turn 66>	<v Olivia>:  that's the whole situation that once maybe you knew where to go, but now, there's a better way for you to get to where you're going and you have </v>
	
	00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.340
<Turn 67>	<v Olivia>:  applications that will tell you whether traffic </v>
	
	00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.030
<Turn 68>	<v Peter>: I  I agree with that. I think </v>
	
	00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.060
<Turn 69>	<v Peter>:  um </v>
	
	00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.820
<Turn 70>	<v Peter>:  here's almost a question for you.  You talked about critical thinking and I think that's the biggest challenge. How do we </v>
	
	00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.700
<Turn 71>	<v Peter>:  maintain the development of critical thinking in the world of AI and </v>
	
	00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.900
<Turn 72>	<v Peter>:  yeah I mean I think you've  you've heard me already say that the system is very traditional but in terms of the way that students are tested </v>
	
	00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.480
<Turn 73>	<v Peter>:  writing an essay, write in a paper </v>
	
	00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.310
<Turn 74>	<v Peter>: I think that's a fundamental problem because it's not very realistic.</v>
	
	00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.580
<Turn 75>	<v Peter>: How often do you have to go out </v>
	
	00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.660
<Turn 76>	<v Peter>:  in the real world and write a five page essay.</v>
	
	00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.220
<Turn 77>	<v Sophie>: </v>
	
	00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.770
<Turn 78>	<v Peter>:  twelve fonts, double spacing on X , Y and Z </v>
	
	00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.520
<Turn 79>	<v Peter>:  especially now that you can get ChatGPT to do it for you. So there must be other ways to test a student's critical thinking </v>
	
	00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.500
<Turn 80>	<v Peter>: Something like um testing them through face-to-face communication.</v>
	
	00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.890
<Turn 81>	<v Peter>: You're not judging </v>
	
	00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.360
<Turn 82>	<v Peter>:  their ability, their articulation ability </v>
	
	00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.160
<Turn 83>	<v Peter>: But do they know the knowledge? Are they able to think </v>
	
	00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.440
<Turn 84>	<v Peter>:  on a higher level?</v>
	
	00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.210
<Turn 85>	<v Peter>: That's innovation into the school system ready, 'cause no one's testing people on </v>
	
	00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.880
<Turn 86>	<v Peter>:  speaking to the extent that they test them on writing an essay which ChatGPT is doing for them anyway.</v>
	
	00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.060
<Turn 87>	<v Jim>:  </v>
	
	00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.830
<Turn 88>	<v Jim>:  I think that's a very good point </v>
	
	00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.010
<Turn 89>	<v Jim>:  but it's </v>
	
	00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.370
<Turn 90>	<v Jim>:  always important to think what skills are we losing, for example with the navigation apps and how many people can actually find their way without </v>
	
	00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.020
<Turn 91>	<v Jim>:  you know apps today </v>
	
	00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.760
<Turn 92>	<v Jim>: And if your phone dies or you're lost, or can you actually find your way around the world? So even that we need to think what </v>
	
	00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.520
<Turn 93>	<v Jim>:  skills are we not teaching anymore that might be important, but y'all, also articulating yourself properly in writing could be a really good thing.</v>
	
	00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.390
<Turn 94>	<v Jim>:  you know even </v>
	
	00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.790
<Turn 95>	<v Jim>:  if you don't write like a </v>
	
	00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.150
<Turn 96>	<v Jim>:  ten page essay, but maybe </v>
	
	00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.770
<Turn 97>	<v Jim>:  we want to have people who can actually write, you know, um clear business documents easily </v>
	
	00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
<Turn 98>	<v Jim>: And so we still need to think about </v>
	
	00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.140
<Turn 99>	<v Jim>:  you know, what skills are we still teaching. They are not just critical thinking which is of course very important </v>
	
	00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.010
<Turn 100>	<v Jim>:  for everything, not just for AI.</v>
	
	00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.310
<Turn 101>	<v Sophie>: It's actually so interesting. I was just like learning about this, how you said that in maps </v>
	
	00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.040
<Turn 102>	<v Jim>: </v>
	
	00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.600
<Turn 103>	<v Sophie>: </v>
	
	00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.380
<Turn 104>	<v Sophie>:  if you don't use map. </v>
